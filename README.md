## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, my name is Brandon!

<br/>

I am a passionate **software engineer**, and I enjoy working on full-stack and low-level development to increase my skill in web development, reverse engineering, documentation, and **much more**.

### About Me

I am most well known for my various modding work on several games, mainly **Kula Quest** for the PlayStation 1.
It was the first video game that I had ever played as a child, so I have a lot of nostalgia for it. It's by far my biggest project, and is the source for how most of my reverse engineering and web development knowledge came to be.

Outside of development, I enjoy **learning new things and teaching others**.
I have a passion for helping other people, and making technology more accessible for everyone.
